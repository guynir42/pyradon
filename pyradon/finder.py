class Finder:
    """
    Streak finding tool.
    Give it some images, using self.input(images, ...)
    This will do all the internal calculations needed to find streaks
    inside each frame. Optional arguments to "input" are:
     -variance: give a scalar (average) variance *or* a variance map.
     -psf: give the point spread function as a scalar width (in this
      case the PSF is a 2D Gaussian with sigma equal to the input scalar)
      *or* a map for the image.
     -frame_num: housekeeping parameter saved to output Streak objects.
     Helps keep track of where each streak was found.
     -batch_num: housekeeping parameter saved to output Streak objects.
     Helps keep track of where each streak was found.
     -filename: housekeeping parameter saved to output Streak objects.
     Helps keep track of where each streak was found.

    SWITCHES AND SETTINGS (see __init__() for more details)
    -Image pre-processing: use_subtract_mean, use_conv.
    -Search options: use_short, min_length
    -Post processing: use_exclude, exclude_dx, exclude_dy
    -memory considerations: use_save_images, use_clear_memory.
    -housekeeping: filename, batch_num, frame_num.
    -display defaults: use_show, display_index, display_which, line_offset,
     rect_size, display_monochrome.

    ALGORITHMS:
    1) Individual images are scanned with the Fast Radon Transform (FRT)
       that does something similar to FFT to sum pixel values along straight
       lines, finding the peaks and saving them as Streak objects.
       The input images must be matched-filtered using an estimate
       of the system PSF. This is also true for point-source detection.
       The FRT of the input image must be divided by an FRT of a
       variance map to normalize the noise and the number of pixels
       in the streak, before any S/N calculations can be made.
       See https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018AJ....156..229N/abstract
    2) To make sure all streaks are found, regardless of brightness,
       there are some steps you need to take.
       Each image must be background subtracted, and once streaks
       are found they need to be subtracted (and b/g resubtracted)
       before searching for other, possibly fainter streaks.
       This object will search a set of thresholds, starting with
       the S/N of the brightest objects in the image, and scanning
       with a threshold that is 2 times smaller on every iteration.
       Before applying a smaller threshold, all pixels in the image
       with point-wise S/N above half the threshold are truncated.
       This removes artefacts and stars, but does not remove streaks,
       that have an aggregated S/N that is above threshold, even
       though each pixel in the streak is below threshold.

    NOTES:
        -the input image can be altered by the process (streak subtraction).
         If you need that image, make a copy of it before inputting.
        -the Radon image that is saved in each streak is already normalized
         by the variance map.
        -If you remove stars or streaks that were found in previous iterations,
         make sure to replace them with NaN. Then use_subtract_mean will ignore
         these pixels when finding the mean. Finally, the NaNs are replaced
         by zero after reducing the mean and before entering the transfrom.

        Iteratively call find_multi() on several values of

        Before running a scan with a given threshold,
        pixels with point-wise S/N above half the threshold
        are truncated, leaving only streaks able to pass the
        threshold because the aggregated S/N of their pixels
        is generally higher than the S/N of each pixel.

        im: np.ndarray of floats
            An image (or subset of images) to be scanned

    trim_corner: scalar int or 2 tuple of int
        Number of rows and columns to trim from the initial
