In column-major order (e.g. MATLAB and FORTRAN):
-Integration is done from left to right, adding whole columns. 
-axis 1 (first index) is the y axis in the input and Radon image (passive axis). 
-axis 2 (second index) is x in the input, dy in the Radon image (active axis). 
-axis 3 (third index) is the dy axis in the partial Radon frames (where axis 2 is still x). 

In row-major order(e.g. C++ and Python):
-Integration is done from top to bottom, adding whole rows. 
-axis 0 (third index) is the x axis in the input and Radon image (passive axis).
-axis 1 (second index) is the y axis in the input, dx in the Radon image (active axis). 
-axis 2 (first index) is the dx axis in the partial Radon frames (where axis 1 is  still y).
